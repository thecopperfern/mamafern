## After Mother's Day

1. Post-purchase email → review request → cross-sell → repeat buyer offer
2. Father's Day (June 21) — reuse this exact campaign framework for Dad collection
3. Analyze which acquisition channel produced highest-LTV buyers — double down for Q3
4. Keep email list warm: weekly content emails, not just promos
