## 1. What Sells in This Niche

### Key Insights from Competitive Research

**1. Small beats loud — by a lot.**
In the crunchy/naturalistic mom demographic, small left-chest and center-chest designs drastically outsell large all-over graphics. The audience values *restraint* as a design choice. A tiny fern leaf on the chest says "I choose this intentionally" the way a giant graphic never can. Think of it as "quiet luxury" for the crunchy set.

**2. One-color prints feel more intentional.**
Single-color screen prints on natural blanks (cream, oat, sage) read as "artisan" and "considered." Two-color prints add depth when the design warrants it (botanicals, detailed illustrations). Three or more colors start feeling mass-produced — avoid it.

**3. Embroidery is the ultimate premium signal.**
Embroidered apparel commands 40–60% higher perceived value than screen-printed equivalents. In the cottagecore/crunchy space, embroidery reads as "handmade, artisanal, worth keeping." The beanie is a great start — consider offering embroidered versions of the Classic Tees and crewnecks as premium tiers later.

**4. Cream/Natural is the #1 colorway.**
Across every successful crunchy/natural family brand, cream and natural blanks outsell colored blanks roughly 2:1. Sage green is the strong #2 for this demographic. Dusty rose appeals to the gift-buyer persona. Always photograph cream first — it's your hero color.

**5. Matching family sets drive 2.5–3× AOV.**
The single most powerful revenue lever for family brands is coordinated designs across adult and kid sizes. When a customer sees their whole family in matching pieces, they buy all of them. The naming convention (Mama Fern → Papa Fern → Little Fern) is already your biggest cross-sell tool.

**6. The design should feel like a nature journal sketch.**
The aesthetic that resonates most with this audience: hand-drawn line art that looks like it was sketched in a field guide or nature journal. Not digitally perfect vectors. Not polished clipart. Imperfect, warm, organic line work with slight variation — like someone drew it with a fine-tip pen on textured paper.

**7. Text on garments works when it's a quiet identity statement.**
"mama fern" in handwritten script is perfect — it's an identity badge, not a slogan. "rooted" works because it's a single evocative word. "nature explorer" works for kids because it's playful and aspirational. Avoid full sentences or preachy phrases.

**8. Botanical motifs that sell best in this niche:**
- Fern fronds (your core icon — own this)
- Wildflower bouquets (lavender, daisies, Queen Anne's lace)
- Mushrooms (cottagecore crossover appeal)
- Acorns and oak leaves (grounded, rooted)
- Snails and butterflies (gentle nature, kids love them)
- Root systems (metaphor for family, growth)
- Fiddlehead ferns (unfurling = new beginnings, perfect for baby products)

## 2. Design Strategy Matrix

### Print Technique Assignments

| # | Product | Technique | Colors | Placement | Why |
|---|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Mama Fern Classic Tee | **One-color screen print** | Warm brown on light; cream on dark | Left chest (small) | Foundational piece — minimal is the point |
| 2 | Mama Fern Rooted Crewneck | **Two-color screen print** | Forest green + warm brown | Center chest (large) | Statement piece justifies the extra color |
| 3 | Papa Fern Classic Tee | **One-color screen print** | Warm brown on light; cream on dark | Left chest (small) | Must match Mama version for family sets |
| 4 | Papa Fern Rooted Crewneck | **Two-color screen print** | Forest green + warm brown | Center chest (large) | Mirrors the women's crewneck |
| 5 | Little Fern Sprout Tee | **One-color screen print** | Warm brown on light; cream on dark | Center chest (small) | Keep it sweet and simple for kids |
| 6 | Little Fern Seedling Onesie | **One-color screen print** | Warm brown on cream; cream on sage | Center chest (small) | Baby items stay gentle and minimal |
| 7 | Mama Fern Canvas Tote | **One-color screen print** | Forest green on natural canvas | Center front (large) | Single-color on canvas = classic market tote feel |
| 8 | Mama Fern Cozy Beanie | **Embroidery** | Thread matches blank variant | Fold-up cuff (small) | The premium anchor — embroidery elevates a beanie to gift-worthy |
| 9 | Mama Fern Wildflower Tee | **Two-color screen print** | Forest green + warm brown | Center chest (medium) | Hero Mother's Day product — the floral needs two colors to breathe |
| 10 | Little Fern Explorer Tee | **Two-color screen print** | Forest green + warm brown | Center chest (medium) | The icon grid needs two tones for depth |

### Alternation Pattern
- **One-color:** Products 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 (5 items — the everyday staples)
- **Two-color:** Products 2, 4, 9, 10 (4 items — the detailed designs)
- **Embroidery:** Product 8 (1 item — the premium accent piece)

This ratio (50% one-color / 40% two-color / 10% embroidery) keeps production costs manageable while offering visual variety across the catalog.

### Future Embroidery Expansion (Post-Launch)
Once the beanie validates embroidery demand:
- **Mama Fern Embroidered Classic Tee** — $42 (small fern leaf, left chest, same placement as screen print version)
- **Papa Fern Embroidered Classic Tee** — $42
- **Embroidered Crewneck** — $62 (small fern on left chest instead of the large "rooted" print)

These become premium tiers sitting above the screen-printed versions in the same collection. The screen print is the entry point; embroidery is the upgrade.

## 3. Nano Banana Pro — Product Artwork Prompts

> **How to use these prompts:** Copy each prompt into Nano Banana Pro. The output should be a clean vector-style or line-art illustration suitable for screen printing. You may need to refine, remove backgrounds, and prepare the file for your screen printer.
>
> **Important:** These prompts generate the *artwork/design* that goes ON the product (not the product itself). You'll need to separately create mockups (see Section 7).

### Global Style Notes for All Prompts
Before each prompt, consider prefixing with this style anchor if Nano Banana Pro supports system-level style instructions:

> **Style anchor:** Hand-drawn botanical line art, nature journal illustration style, fine pen ink drawing, organic imperfect lines, warm and earthy, vintage field guide aesthetic, not digitally perfect, slight line weight variation, on transparent or white background

---

### Product 1: Mama Fern Classic Tee — Left Chest Design

**Print type:** One-color
**Ink color:** Warm brown (#6B4D3E) on cream/sage blanks; cream (#FAF7F2) on dark blanks
**Size on garment:** ~3" × 3.5" left chest

```
PROMPT:
A small, delicate hand-drawn fern frond illustration in a single color, pen and ink style, with the words "mama fern" written below in loose handwritten script lettering. The fern should be a single unfurling frond with 6-8 leaflets, slightly curved, naturalistic but imperfect like a field guide sketch. The text should feel organic and personal, like handwriting in a journal — not a font. Design is compact, meant for left chest placement on a t-shirt. White or transparent background. Single color only — no gradients, no shading, just clean line art with slight line weight variation. Botanical illustration style, minimal, warm, cottagecore aesthetic.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same design but with the fern frond arching over the text like a gentle canopy"
- "Same design but with two small crossed fern fronds above the text"
- "Same design but with a tiny fiddlehead curl accent next to the text"

---

### Product 2: Mama Fern Rooted Crewneck — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** Two-color
**Ink colors:** Forest green (#4A6741) for lettering + warm brown (#6B4D3E) for roots
**Size on garment:** ~10" × 8" center chest

```
PROMPT:
Hand-lettered serif word "rooted" in large, elegant letterforms with a botanical twist — delicate fern root system growing downward from the bottom of the letters, as if the word itself is a living plant putting down roots. The roots should be fine, organic, hand-drawn pen lines that branch and spread naturally, getting thinner toward the tips. The word uses traditional serif letterforms but hand-drawn with slight imperfections so it feels crafted, not typed. Two-color design: the word "rooted" in one color (forest green) and the root system illustration in a second color (warm brown). No background. Print-ready line art suitable for screen printing on fabric. Nature journal illustration style, botanical, grounded, minimal.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but with small fern leaves sprouting upward from the top of some letters"
- "Same concept but with the roots transforming into a gentle fern frond at the bottom"
- "Same concept but with tiny mushrooms and fiddleheads growing among the roots"

---

### Product 3: Papa Fern Classic Tee — Left Chest Design

**Print type:** One-color
**Ink color:** Warm brown (#6B4D3E) on cream/oat blanks; cream (#FAF7F2) on dark blanks
**Size on garment:** ~3" × 3.5" left chest

```
PROMPT:
A small, hand-drawn fern frond illustration in a single color, pen and ink style, with the words "papa fern" written below in loose handwritten script lettering. The fern should be a single sturdy frond with 6-8 leaflets, similar to the "mama fern" version but very slightly bolder in line weight to feel subtly more masculine while maintaining the same botanical hand-drawn aesthetic. The text should feel organic and personal, like handwriting in a nature journal. Design is compact, meant for left chest placement on a unisex t-shirt. White or transparent background. Single color only — clean line art, no gradients, slight line weight variation. Botanical illustration style, minimal, warm.
```

**Note:** The Papa Fern design must be visually recognizable as the companion to the Mama Fern Classic Tee. Same fern, same script style, same size — just the text changes. This is what makes the family set work.

---

### Product 4: Papa Fern Rooted Crewneck — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** Two-color
**Ink colors:** Forest green (#4A6741) + warm brown (#6B4D3E)
**Size on garment:** ~10" × 8" center chest

```
PROMPT:
Hand-lettered serif word "rooted" in large, elegant letterforms — identical to the Mama Fern version — with a delicate fern root system growing downward from the bottom of the letters. The roots are fine, organic, hand-drawn pen lines that branch naturally. Two-color design: "rooted" in forest green, root system in warm brown. This is the matching men's/unisex version of the women's crewneck design — the artwork is identical, only the garment cut changes. No background. Print-ready line art for screen printing. Nature journal style, botanical, grounded.
```

**Note:** Use the exact same artwork file as Product 2. The design doesn't change between men's and women's crewnecks — only the blank garment changes.

---

### Product 5: Little Fern Sprout Tee — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** One-color
**Ink color:** Warm brown (#6B4D3E) on cream; cream on sage
**Size on garment:** ~3.5" × 4" center chest (scaled for kids 2T–8Y)

```
PROMPT:
A small, adorable hand-drawn sprouting fern illustration — a baby fern just emerging from the soil, with 2-3 tiny unfurling fiddlehead fronds and one small root visible below a simple soil line. Below the illustration, the words "little fern" in playful, slightly bouncy hand-lettered text that feels childlike but not sloppy. Single color only, pen and ink line art style. The overall feeling should be sweet, gentle, and whimsical — like a page from a children's nature picture book. Compact design for center chest placement on a kids t-shirt. No background. No gradients. Botanical illustration, minimal, nature-inspired.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but the sprout has a tiny snail sitting next to it"
- "Same concept but with small dots or stars scattered around the sprout like morning dew"
- "Same concept but the fiddleheads are in different stages of unfurling"

---

### Product 6: Little Fern Seedling Onesie — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** One-color
**Ink color:** Warm brown (#6B4D3E) on cream; cream (#FAF7F2) on sage
**Size on garment:** ~2.5" × 3" center chest (scaled for baby bodysuit)

```
PROMPT:
A tiny, delicate cluster of 3 small fern leaves arranged in a gentle bunch, hand-drawn in fine pen and ink line art style. Below the leaf cluster, the word "seedling" in small, delicate hand-lettered script — the text should be soft and gentle, like whispered handwriting. Single color, no shading or gradients. The overall design should feel precious and tiny, like a botanical sketch in a baby book. Very compact — this goes on a baby onesie chest. White or transparent background. Nature journal illustration, minimal, warm, tender.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but with the three leaves slightly overlapping like they're cuddling"
- "Same concept but replace the cluster with a single tiny fiddlehead fern curl"
- "Same concept but add two tiny dots above the text like a colon, like a sleepy baby face :)"

---

### Product 7: Mama Fern Canvas Tote — Full Front Design

**Print type:** One-color
**Ink color:** Forest green (#4A6741) on natural canvas
**Size on garment:** ~10" × 10" center front

```
PROMPT:
A circular botanical wreath made of hand-drawn fern fronds, with the words "mama fern" hand-lettered in elegant script centered inside the wreath. The wreath should be made of 8-12 individual fern fronds arranged in a loose, organic circle — not a perfect geometric ring but a natural, slightly imperfect wreath like something gathered from a forest floor. The fronds should vary slightly in size and angle. The text inside should feel warm and personal, handwritten script that complements the botanical wreath without competing with it. Single color only, line art, pen and ink style. Sized for printing on a canvas tote bag — approximately 10 inches diameter. No background. No gradients. Botanical illustration, cottagecore, farmer's market aesthetic.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but with wildflowers mixed into the fern wreath — daisies, lavender, small buds"
- "Same concept but the wreath is open at the top, like a crescent of ferns with text in the center"
- "Same concept but add a small acorn or mushroom tucked into the bottom of the wreath"

---

### Product 8: Mama Fern Cozy Beanie — Embroidery Design

> See **Section 4** for the embroidery-specific prompt. The beanie design needs to be created as an embroidery-ready file, not a screen print.

---

### Product 9: Mama Fern Wildflower Tee — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** Two-color
**Ink colors:** Forest green (#4A6741) for stems/leaves + warm brown (#6B4D3E) for flowers/text
**Size on garment:** ~5" × 6" center chest

```
PROMPT:
A delicate hand-drawn wildflower bouquet illustration featuring a mix of small botanical elements: fern fronds, daisy-like flowers, lavender sprigs, and tiny seed pods, loosely gathered as if hand-picked from a meadow. Below the bouquet, the phrase "wildly rooted" in small, elegant hand-lettered script. The bouquet should feel airy and natural — not a tight, formal arrangement but a casual, just-picked-from-the-garden bunch with stems slightly overlapping and leaves reaching different directions. Two-color design: all stems, leaves, and fern elements in one color (forest green), all flower heads, petals, and the text in a second color (warm brown). No background. Hand-drawn pen and ink style with slight line weight variation. This is a Mother's Day hero product — it should feel special, gift-worthy, and feminine without being fussy. Botanical illustration, cottagecore, nature journal aesthetic.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but the bouquet is tied with a simple ribbon bow at the stems"
- "Same concept but more emphasis on ferns with just 2-3 small flowers peeking through"
- "Same concept but arranged vertically — tall and narrow like a pressed flower bookmark"

---

### Product 10: Little Fern Nature Explorer Tee — Center Chest Design

**Print type:** Two-color
**Ink colors:** Forest green (#4A6741) + warm brown (#6B4D3E)
**Size on garment:** ~5" × 5" center chest (scaled for kids 2T–8Y)

```
PROMPT:
A playful grid of 6 small hand-drawn nature icons arranged in a 3×2 or 2×3 layout: a mushroom, an acorn, a fern frond, a snail, a butterfly, and a pine cone. Each icon should be a simple, charming line drawing — the style of a nature scavenger hunt checklist in a children's activity book. Above the grid, the words "nature explorer" in playful, slightly chunky hand-lettered block letters that feel adventurous and fun. Two-color design: alternate the icons between forest green and warm brown so the grid has a rhythmic color pattern. The text in forest green. The overall feeling should be curious, outdoorsy, and kid-friendly — like a badge of honor for a little adventurer. No background. Hand-drawn line art. Botanical and nature illustration, whimsical, minimal.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same concept but arrange the icons in a circle around the text instead of a grid"
- "Same concept but add a seventh icon — a small bird — and arrange as a scattered constellation"
- "Same concept but make it feel like a hand-stamped collection, with slight rotation on each icon"

## 4. Nano Banana Pro — Embroidery Design Prompts

> **Important:** Embroidery designs need to work as thread art — clean shapes, limited detail, no tiny gaps. The output from Nano Banana Pro will need to be digitized for embroidery (converted to stitch files: .DST, .PES, or .EXP). Keep designs simple with clear outlines.

### Product 8: Mama Fern Cozy Beanie — Cuff Embroidery

**Technique:** Chain-stitch embroidery
**Size:** ~1.5" × 1.5" on fold-up cuff
**Thread colors:** Forest green on oatmeal; cream on sage; warm brown on dusty rose

```
PROMPT:
A single, small fern frond designed for embroidery on a knit beanie cuff. The frond should be simple and clean — one central stem with 5-7 pairs of small leaflets branching off symmetrically. The lines should be slightly thick and smooth, suitable for chain-stitch embroidery at 1.5 inches tall. No text — the fern leaf alone is the design. The frond should have a gentle natural curve, not perfectly straight. Think of a pressed fern leaf in a nature journal, simplified for stitching. Clean outlines only, no fine detail that would be lost at small embroidery size. Single color. White or transparent background. Botanical, minimal, organic.
```

**Variations to try:**
- "Same fern but with a tiny fiddlehead curl at the top, like the frond is still unfurling"
- "Two small fern fronds crossed at the stems, like a tiny botanical X mark"
- "A single fern frond inside a small embroidered circle outline"

### Future Embroidery: Classic Tee Premium Upgrade

**For when you're ready to offer embroidered tees at a premium price point ($42):**

```
PROMPT:
A small, elegant fern frond designed for embroidery on a t-shirt left chest pocket area. The frond is 2 inches tall, with a single curving stem and 6-8 pairs of leaflets. Below the frond, the words "mama fern" in a clean, simple single-line script — the text should be readable at embroidery scale (about 0.3 inches tall). The overall design fits within a 2" × 2.5" area. Clean, smooth lines suitable for satin stitch and running stitch embroidery. No fine details smaller than 1mm. Single color (will be stitched in matching thread). Minimal, botanical, premium feel.
```

### Future Embroidery: Crewneck Premium Upgrade

**For an embroidered left-chest fern on crewneck sweatshirts ($62):**

```
PROMPT:
A slightly larger fern frond designed for embroidery on a sweatshirt left chest area. The frond is 2.5 inches tall with generous spacing between leaflets (embroidery on heavy fleece fabric needs more room). One elegant curved stem with 8-10 pairs of leaflets. No text — the embroidered fern alone serves as the brand mark. The design should feel like a subtle, elevated brand badge. Clean outlines, smooth curves, suitable for satin stitch at 2.5 inches on cotton/polyester fleece. Single color. Botanical, premium, understated.
```

## 5. Nano Banana Pro — Hero Image Prompts

> These prompts generate lifestyle imagery for the website — hero banners, collection headers, and editorial-style photography. They should show the *feeling* of the brand, not just the products.

### Homepage Hero Banner

```
PROMPT:
A warm, sun-drenched lifestyle photograph of a young family — a mother, father, and toddler — walking through a lush green fern garden or forest path. They are dressed in minimal, natural-toned clothing: cream and sage green t-shirts and earth-toned pants. The mother carries the toddler on her hip. Dappled golden hour sunlight filters through the fern canopy above. The mood is calm, grounded, and joyful — not posed or commercial, but a real moment. Soft focus on the greenery, sharp on the family. Color palette: cream, sage green, warm brown, golden light. Film photography aesthetic with slight grain. Cottagecore, natural, organic family lifestyle. Horizontal composition, 16:9 aspect ratio for a website hero banner.
```

**Alt versions:**
```
PROMPT (indoor version):
A warm lifestyle photograph of a mother and young child sitting on a worn wooden floor in a bright, minimal room with natural light streaming through large windows. Both wear matching cream-colored organic cotton t-shirts. There are potted ferns and simple wooden furniture in the background. A sourdough loaf and cast iron skillet are subtly visible on a kitchen counter in the background. The mood is cozy, slow, and grounded — like a Sunday morning with nowhere to be. Film photography look, warm tones, slight grain. Horizontal 16:9 composition.
```

```
PROMPT (product-focused hero):
A flat-lay photograph on a natural linen surface: a cream-colored t-shirt neatly folded, a sage green baby onesie, a canvas tote bag, and an oatmeal knit beanie — arranged with sprigs of fresh fern, dried lavender, and a small terracotta pot. Overhead shot. Natural daylight, soft shadows. The arrangement feels curated but effortless, like someone laid out their favorite things on a kitchen table. Warm, earthy color palette: cream, sage, oatmeal, warm brown, terracotta accents. Styled editorial flat-lay photography. Square or 16:9 composition.
```

### Collection Page Headers

```
PROMPT (For Moms collection):
A close-up lifestyle photograph of a woman's hands holding a warm mug, wearing a cream-colored crewneck sweatshirt with a subtle botanical design visible at the chest. She is sitting on a wooden porch with ferns and potted plants around her. Morning light, warm tones. Only her hands, torso, and the mug are in frame — her face is cropped or turned away. The focus is on the feeling: calm, grounded, cozy. Film photography aesthetic. Horizontal 3:1 aspect ratio for a collection page banner.
```

```
PROMPT (For Dads collection):
A lifestyle photograph of a father from behind, holding a small child's hand as they walk a dirt trail through a forest. He wears an oatmeal-colored crewneck sweatshirt. The child wears a small sage green t-shirt. Warm golden backlight through the trees. The mood is quiet, adventurous, and tender. Film photography aesthetic, warm earth tones. Horizontal 3:1 aspect ratio.
```

```
PROMPT (For Kids collection):
A joyful lifestyle photograph of two young children — one toddler and one around age 5 — playing in a grassy field dotted with wildflowers. They wear cream and sage earthy-toned children's t-shirts. Soft, diffused afternoon light. One child is crouched looking at a dandelion. The other is mid-laugh. The mood is free, playful, and wild — like a real family photo, not a fashion shoot. Warm, natural tones. Film photography, slight grain. Horizontal 3:1 aspect ratio.
```

```
PROMPT (Accessories collection):
An artistic still-life photograph: a canvas tote bag hanging on an aged wooden peg, a knit beanie draped over the peg beside it, with a fresh fern frond tucked into the tote. Below the peg, a pair of worn leather boots and a small potted succulent. Natural window light from the left. The scene feels like the entryway of a cozy cabin or farmhouse. Earth tones: natural canvas, oat, sage, worn wood. Editorial still-life photography. Horizontal 3:1 aspect ratio.
```

```
PROMPT (Mother's Day collection):
A tender, intimate photograph of a mother sitting in a sunlit room with her baby in her lap. She wears a dusty rose t-shirt with a subtle floral design. The baby wears a cream onesie. Fresh wildflowers in a simple ceramic vase on a table beside them. The light is golden, warm, and soft. The image feels like a love letter — quiet, personal, beautiful. Film photography aesthetic, warm tones, slight grain. Horizontal 3:1 or 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### About Page / Brand Story Image

```
PROMPT:
An editorial-style photograph of a woman's hands pressing dried fern fronds into an open journal or sketchbook on a rustic wooden table. Beside the journal: a cup of tea, a spool of natural twine, and a few scattered dried wildflowers. Natural window light. The image represents the design process and the botanical inspiration behind the brand. Warm, earthy, analog feeling — like looking at someone's creative process from above. Overhead angle. Film photography, warm tones. Square composition.
```

## 6. Nano Banana Pro — Social Content & Animation Prompts

> These prompts are for short-form visual content: animated loops, video-style content, and social media assets. Adapt based on what Nano Banana Pro supports (static with motion elements, GIFs, short video clips, etc.).

### Animated Logo / Brand Mark

```
PROMPT:
A gentle animation of a single fern frond slowly unfurling from a fiddlehead curl to a full frond, drawn in fine pen and ink botanical line art style. The animation should feel organic and slow — like watching a time-lapse of a real fern growing. As the frond reaches full extension, the words "mama fern" fade in below in handwritten script. Earthy forest green color (#4A6741) on a warm cream background (#FAF7F2). Looping animation that plays over 3-4 seconds. Minimal, botanical, nature-inspired. Clean line art.
```

### Product Reveal Animation

```
PROMPT:
A stop-motion style animation of botanical elements appearing one by one — first a fern frond is drawn onto the frame, then a wildflower, then a mushroom, then text, building up to reveal a complete t-shirt design. The drawing happens in real-time, like watching an artist's hand sketch on paper. Pen and ink line art style. Warm cream paper background with forest green and warm brown ink. 5-6 second animation. The "making of" the artwork feeling. Nature journal aesthetic.
```

### Social Media Story Templates

```
PROMPT (New Arrival announcement):
A minimal animated graphic for an Instagram Story: a cream background with a gently swaying fern frond illustration in the top corner (subtle, slow motion). In the center, elegant serif text reads "new arrival" in forest green. Below, a circular photo placeholder area. The bottom has small text: "mamafern.com". The animation is subtle — just the fern swaying gently, like a breeze. Warm, earthy brand aesthetic. 9:16 vertical format.
```

```
PROMPT (Sale / Promotion):
A warm, minimal animated graphic: an oat-colored textured paper background. A botanical fern wreath illustration slowly rotates or breathes (gently pulsing) in the center. Inside the wreath, text appears: "garden sale" in hand-lettered script, then "up to 30% off" fades in below. Warm brown and forest green colors only. Cottagecore, minimal, not aggressive. 9:16 vertical format for Instagram Stories.
```

```
PROMPT (Customer feature / UGC repost):
A minimal frame template for reposting customer photos: thin botanical border made of simple fern line art around the edges of the frame. Small "mama fern" text in handwritten script at the bottom right corner. The frame is mostly transparent/open to feature the customer photo in the center. Forest green line art on transparent background. 1:1 square format for Instagram feed.
```

### TikTok / Reels Content Concepts

```
PROMPT (Fabric close-up):
An extreme close-up cinematic shot of organic cotton fabric texture — the weave is visible, the material looks incredibly soft. A hand gently touches and scrunches the fabric. Natural light. The color is warm cream/natural white. Macro photography feel. The shot slowly zooms out to reveal it's a folded t-shirt with a small fern design on the chest. Warm, tactile, ASMR-adjacent. 9:16 vertical format.
```

```
PROMPT (Unboxing moment):
An overhead shot of two hands opening a kraft paper package tied with natural twine. Inside: tissue paper in a sage green color. The hands slowly unwrap to reveal a cream-colored t-shirt folded neatly with a small dried fern sprig tucked in as a gift detail. The tabletop is warm wood. Natural light. The feeling is "opening a gift from a friend." Slow, intentional, satisfying. 9:16 vertical format.
```

```
PROMPT (Family matching moment):
A slow-motion lifestyle clip: a mother, father, and toddler walking toward the camera in a sunlit meadow or park. They all wear coordinating cream and sage clothing (matching Mama Fern / Papa Fern / Little Fern pieces). They look at each other and laugh. Golden hour backlight. The mood is warm, authentic, joyful — like a real moment, not a commercial. Film-look with slight grain and warm color grade. 9:16 vertical or 16:9 horizontal.
```

### Seasonal Campaign Animations

```
PROMPT (Mother's Day):
A soft, emotional animation: a child's hand (drawn in line art style) reaches up to give a hand-drawn wildflower bouquet to a mother's hand. The flowers bloom as they're passed. Text appears: "for the wildly rooted ones" in elegant handwritten script. Color palette: forest green stems with dusty rose and warm brown flower accents on a cream background. 4-5 second animation. Tender, warm, botanical. Could work as an Instagram post or email header.
```

```
PROMPT (Earth Day):
A gentle animation of seeds being planted in illustrated soil — small fern sprouts growing upward in a time-lapse effect, hand-drawn line art style. As the ferns grow, text appears among them: "rooted in something real" in hand-lettered script. Forest green and warm brown on cream background. 4-5 second loop. Nature, growth, sustainability feeling.
```

## 7. Nano Banana Pro — Mockup & Lifestyle Prompts

### Flat-Lay Mockups

```
PROMPT (Classic Tee flat-lay):
A styled flat-lay photograph of a cream-colored relaxed-fit women's t-shirt laid flat on a natural linen surface. The shirt has a small, subtle botanical fern design with handwritten text on the left chest area. Beside the shirt: a sprig of fresh fern, a pair of gold hoop earrings, and a simple ceramic mug. Overhead shot. Natural daylight, soft shadows. The arrangement feels minimal, curated, and warm. Earth tone color palette. Editorial product photography.
```

PROMPT (Crewneck flat-lay):
A styled flat-lay of a cream crewneck sweatshirt on a rustic wooden table. The sweatshirt has the word "rooted" in serif lettering with a botanical root illustration on the chest. Beside it: an open book, a dried eucalyptus bundle, and a small terracotta pot with a fern. Overhead shot, natural light. Cozy, earthy, cottagecore. Editorial flat-lay product photography.
```

```
PROMPT (Baby onesie flat-lay):
A sweet, minimal flat-lay of a small cream baby bodysuit on a soft cream muslin blanket. The onesie has a tiny fern design and "seedling" text on the chest. Beside it: a small knit beanie, a wooden rattle, and a fresh fern leaf. Overhead shot, soft natural light. The mood is tender, new-baby gentle. Warm neutral tones. Editorial baby product photography.
```

```
PROMPT (Complete family set flat-lay):
An editorial flat-lay showing three garments arranged together on a natural linen surface: a women's cream t-shirt (mama fern design), a men's cream t-shirt (papa fern design), and a small baby cream onesie (seedling design). The three pieces are arranged from largest to smallest, slightly overlapping. Fresh fern fronds and small wildflowers are scattered around them. Overhead shot, natural light. The image immediately communicates "family set." Warm, earthy, coordinated. Editorial product photography.

### On-Model Mockups

```
PROMPT (Women's tee on model):
A lifestyle photograph of a woman in her early 30s wearing a relaxed cream t-shirt with a small botanical fern design on the left chest. She is outdoors in soft natural light — perhaps leaning against a wooden fence post with greenery behind her. Her style is effortless: messy bun, minimal jewelry, relaxed jeans. The focus is on the shirt and her natural, grounded energy. She looks warm and approachable, not "model perfect." Film photography aesthetic, warm earth tones. Half-body shot, slightly off-center composition.
```

```
PROMPT (Men's tee on model):
A lifestyle photograph of a man in his early 30s wearing a sage green t-shirt with a small fern and "papa fern" design on the left chest. He is holding a young child (toddler) who is looking to the side. They are in a bright, minimal kitchen with wooden countertops and potted plants. The man looks relaxed and present. Warm natural light from a window. Film photography feel, muted earth tones. Half-body shot.
```

```
PROMPT (Kids tee on model):
A joyful photograph of a 4-year-old child wearing a cream t-shirt with a small botanical "nature explorer" design on the chest. The child is crouched down examining something on the ground — a bug, a leaf, a flower — in an outdoor garden setting. Natural light, warm tones. The image captures genuine childhood curiosity. Not posed, not looking at camera. Film photography aesthetic. Full-body or 3/4 shot.

## 9. Production Notes

### Screen Printing Specifications

**File format for screen printer:** Vector files (AI, EPS, or high-res PDF). If Nano Banana Pro outputs raster images (PNG/JPG), you'll need to vector-trace them in Adobe Illustrator or use an online vectorizer.

**Resolution requirements:**
- Screen prints: Vector preferred; raster minimum 300 DPI at actual print size
- Embroidery: Needs digitization (stitch file conversion) — your embroiderer or a digitizing service can convert the artwork
- The simpler the design, the cleaner the print and the cheaper the setup cost

**Screen printing cost impact by color count:**
| Colors | Setup Cost | Per-Unit Add | Production Speed |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 color | $25–$40/screen | Base price | Fastest |
| 2 color | $50–$80/2 screens | +$0.50–$1.00/unit | Standard |
| 3+ color | $75–$120+/screens | +$1.00–$2.00/unit | Slower, more registration |

Staying at 1–2 colors keeps per-unit cost low and turnaround fast — critical for a bootstrapped launch.

### Embroidery Specifications

**Stitch count estimate for beanie fern leaf (1.5" × 1.5"):** ~2,000–3,500 stitches
**Digitizing cost:** ~$15–$30 one-time (per design)
**Per-unit embroidery cost:** ~$2–$5 per piece (depends on volume and stitch count)
**Thread type:** Polyester embroidery thread (more durable than rayon on knitwear)

### Artwork Checklist Before Sending to Printer

- [ ] Design is clean vector or 300+ DPI raster at actual print size
- [ ] Colors are separated (one layer per ink color for multi-color prints)
- [ ] Background is transparent (no white box around the design)
- [ ] Dimensions specified: width × height at final garment placement
- [ ] Placement template provided (left chest at 3" from collar, center chest at X", etc.)
- [ ] Color callouts match Pantone or provide physical swatch
- [ ] For embroidery: separate digitization file (.DST/.PES/.EXP) from embroiderer

### Prompt Refinement Tips for Nano Banana Pro

1. **If the output is too detailed:** Add "simplified line art, minimal detail, clean outlines only"
2. **If the output is too digital/perfect:** Add "hand-drawn imperfection, slight line weight variation, organic feel"
3. **If the output has unwanted colors:** Add "strictly single color, monochromatic, no color variation"
4. **If the output isn't screen-print-ready:** Add "high contrast, no gradients, no halftones, solid lines only"
5. **If the text isn't right:** Generate the illustration without text, then add typography manually in Illustrator or Canva
6. **Run each prompt 4–6 times** and pick the best output — AI generation has variance, and you want options
7. **For the family-matching designs (Products 1, 3, 5, 6):** Generate the Mama Fern version first, then use it as a style reference for the Papa/Little versions to maintain visual cohesion
