## 1. Brand Naming System

Every product uses the Mama Fern family naming convention. This creates instant cross-sell psychology — when a customer sees "Mama Fern Tee," they immediately understand there's a "Papa Fern Tee" and a "Little Fern Tee" to complete the set.

| Family Member | Prefix | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Mom | **Mama Fern** | Mama Fern Everyday Tee |
| Dad | **Papa Fern** | Papa Fern Everyday Tee |
| Kids (2T–8) | **Little Fern** | Little Fern Everyday Tee |
| Baby (NB–24M) | **Baby Fern** | Baby Fern Onesie |
| Unisex / Accessories | **Fern** | The Fern Tote |

### Product Name Format

`[Family Prefix] + [Product Name] + [Optional: Design Name]`

Examples:
- Mama Fern Everyday Tee — Rooted
- Papa Fern Classic Crewneck — Sage
- Little Fern Bodysuit — Little Sprout
- The Fern Market Tote

## 2. The 10 Evergreen Products

These are the always-available core SKUs. They anchor the store when seasonal drops sell out, serve as the entry point for new customers, and generate the majority of repeat purchases.

### Product 1: Mama Fern Everyday Tee

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Women's Tee |
| **Fit** | Relaxed, slightly oversized — not boxy, not fitted |
| **Fabric** | 100% GOTS-certified organic cotton, 5.3 oz mid-weight |
| **Sizes** | XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL |
| **Colorways** | Oat Cream, Sage Green, Warm Terracotta, Soft Clay |
| **Design** | Small "mama fern" script embroidered on left chest, delicate fern leaf beside text |
| **Feel** | Pre-washed for softness. Lived-in from day one. |
| **Shopify Handle** | `mama-fern-everyday-tee` |
| **Collection** | `moms`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** This is the hero product. Every mom customer starts here. It's the most giftable, most photographed, most shared piece in the line. The relaxed fit means it works postpartum, pregnant, or just wanting comfort.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> The tee you'll reach for every single morning. 100% organic cotton, pre-washed soft, designed to feel like it's already yours. Small fern embroidery on the chest — enough to say something without shouting it. Runs true to size; size up one for an extra-oversized drape.

---

### Product 2: Papa Fern Everyday Tee

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Men's Tee |
| **Fit** | Classic relaxed, standard men's cut |

| **Design** | Small "papa fern" script embroidered on left chest, fern leaf beside text |
| **Shopify Handle** | `papa-fern-everyday-tee` |
| **Collection** | `dads`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** Completes the family set with the Mama Fern Tee. Dads buy this for themselves or — more often — moms buy it for their partner when ordering their own tee. This is an AOV multiplier.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> Same organic cotton softness, built for dad. Relaxed fit that actually fits — no billowing, no shrinking. Small fern embroidery on the chest. Pair it with the Mama Fern Tee and suddenly you're that couple.

---

### Product 3: Little Fern Kids Tee

| Attribute | Detail |

| **Shopify Handle** | `little-fern-kids-tee` |
| **Collection** | `kids`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** Matching family tees are the single strongest AOV driver. The Family Coordinator persona (Sarah, 33) buys all three in the same colorway for family photos, holidays, and everyday coordination.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> The littlest fern in the family. Same organic cotton as the grown-up versions, scaled down for tiny humans who refuse to stay still. Pre-washed, gentle on sensitive skin, cute enough for pictures, tough enough for playgrounds.

---

### Product 4: Baby Fern Onesie

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|

| **Design** | "baby fern" in soft hand-lettered script with a tiny curled fern frond (fiddlehead) |
| **Shopify Handle** | `baby-fern-onesie` |
| **Collection** | `kids`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** The #1 baby shower gift. The #1 new-mom self-purchase. Onesies are the highest-volume baby apparel item and the easiest entry point for the gift buyer persona.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> The softest thing they'll wear. 100% organic cotton bodysuit with nickel-free snaps — because tiny skin deserves the gentlest everything. The fiddlehead fern graphic is our way of saying every little one starts curled up and slowly unfurls into something beautiful.

---

| **Shopify Handle** | `mama-fern-cozy-crewneck` |
| **Collection** | `moms`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** The premium anchor product. This is the upsell from the Everyday Tee — higher price point, higher perceived value, higher margin. Fall and winter hero product but sells year-round in air-conditioned spaces and cool mornings.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> The crewneck that ends the search. Organic cotton fleece, brushed on the inside, with that weight that feels like a hug without overheating. Tonal embroidery across the chest — visible up close, subtle from a distance. The one you'll fight your partner for.

**Why it's evergreen:** Completes the crewneck family set. Father's Day hero product, but sells year-round as part of family coordination purchases.

| **Colorways** | Oat Cream, Sage Green, Blush |
| **Design** | "little fern" in playful arched text with a small fern leaf graphic |
| **Shopify Handle** | `little-fern-kids-crewneck` |
| **Collection** | `kids`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** The family crewneck set (Mom + Dad + Kid) is the highest-AOV combination in the store. This is the product that turns a $48 order into a $140 order.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> Mini crewneck, maximum cozy. Same organic cotton fleece as the grown-up versions — because kids deserve the same softness, just in a smaller package. Slightly long in the body so it layers over everything and stays tucked.

---

### Product 8: The Fern Market Tote

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Accessory — Tote Bag |
| **Fit** | 15" x 16" with 10" drop handles |

| **Sizes** | One Size |

| **Design** | "mama fern" script with a line-drawn fern frond, centered on one side |
| **Shopify Handle** | `fern-market-tote` |
| **Collection** | `accessories`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** The lowest-price entry point for non-apparel customers. Gift buyers, first-time customers who aren't ready for a tee, and repeat buyers adding to an order to hit the free shipping threshold. This is a margin booster and a walking billboard.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> Your farmers market companion, your library bag, your everything bag. Heavy-weight organic cotton canvas that gets better with every wash. Carry it full of sourdough and produce and pretend you planned the whole aesthetic. You did.

---

### Product 9: The Fern Beanie

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Accessory — Beanie |
| **Fit** | Cuffed beanie, unisex, one size fits most |
| **Fabric** | 100% organic cotton knit |
| **Sizes** | One Size (Adult) |
| **Colorways** | Oat Cream, Sage Green, Warm Terracotta, Charcoal |
| **Design** | Small embroidered fern leaf on the cuff fold |
| **Shopify Handle** | `fern-beanie` |
| **Collection** | `accessories`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** Impulse add-on. When a customer is $15 away from free shipping, the beanie is the perfect cart addition. It's also the most shareable piece — visible in every selfie, photo, and social post.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> One small fern on the cuff. That's it. No logos screaming, no branding competing with your outfit. Organic cotton knit that breathes in fall and insulates in winter. The beanie you'll lose, rebuy, and refuse to share.

---

### Product 10: The Family Fern Set

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Bundle — Family Tee Set |
| **Contents** | 1x Mama Fern Everyday Tee + 1x Papa Fern Everyday Tee + 1x Little Fern Kids Tee OR Baby Fern Onesie |
| **Fabric** | Same as individual products |
| **Sizes** | Customer selects size for each piece |
| **Colorways** | Coordinated — all three in the same colorway (Oat Cream, Sage Green) |
| **Discount** | 12% off vs. buying individually |
| **Shopify Handle** | `family-fern-set` |
| **Collection** | `family`, `evergreen-staples` |

**Why it's evergreen:** This is the AOV anchor. The Family Coordinator persona buys this as a single purchase. It's the gifting hero for baby showers, Mother's Day, and holidays. It communicates "we're a family brand" more than any other single product listing.

**Product description (Shopify):**
> The whole fern family in one box. Three matching organic cotton pieces — Mama, Papa, and your littlest fern — coordinated in the same colorway so you look intentional without trying. Save 12% versus buying them separately. Choose a Kids Tee (2T–8) or a Baby Onesie (NB–24M) as your third piece.

## 3. Pricing Strategy & Margin Analysis

### Pricing Philosophy

Mama Fern sits in the **mid-premium** tier — above fast fashion ($12–$20 tees), at or slightly below established organic brands ($35–$50 tees). The positioning: quality organic cotton at a price that feels attainable, not aspirational.

**Pricing anchors:**
- Below Pact ($35–$45 for organic basics)
- Above Target/H&M organic lines ($12–$18)
- In line with Mama X Brand ($35–$38 tees, $49 crewnecks)
- Premium enough to signal quality, accessible enough for repeat buying

### COGS Breakdown Notes

COGS estimates include:
- **Blank garment cost** (organic cotton blanks from ethical suppliers — Bella+Canvas organic line, Alternative Apparel, or similar)
- **Decoration** (embroidery or screen print — embroidery for tees/crewnecks at ~$2–3/unit, screen print for graphic designs at ~$1.50–2.50/unit)
- **Packaging** (branded tissue, sticker seal, insert card — ~$0.80–1.20/unit)
- **Hang tags and labels** (~$0.30–0.50/unit)

COGS **does not include**: shipping to customer, Shopify transaction fees (2.9% + $0.30), payment processing, returns, or marketing spend.

### True Unit Economics (Including Platform Costs)

| Papa Fern Tee | $34.00 | $9.50 | $1.29 | $23.21 | 68% |
| Little Fern Kids Tee | $24.00 | $7.00 | $1.00 | $16.00 | 67% |

| Family Fern Set | $79.00 | $23.00 | $2.59 | $53.41 | 68% |

### Free Shipping Threshold Analysis

| Threshold | Logic | Expected Impact |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **$65** | Above a single adult tee ($34) + kids tee ($24) = $58. Forces one more small item. | Moderate AOV lift |
| **$75** (Recommended) | Above two adult tees ($68). Pushes toward adding a kids piece or accessory. | Strong AOV lift |
| **$85** | Above a crewneck + tee ($86 breaks it). Slightly aggressive for launch. | Higher AOV but may reduce conversion |

**Recommendation:** Start at **$75 free shipping threshold**. Revisit at Month 3 based on actual AOV data.

### Compare-At Pricing (Sale Strategy)

Never discount the evergreen line more than 15% outside of specific events. Protect full-price buying behavior.

| Event | Discount | Mechanic |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Launch week | 10% off sitewide | Code: ROOTED10 |
| Mother's Day | 15% off Mom products | Code: MAMA15 |
| Father's Day | 15% off Dad products | Code: PAPA15 |
| Black Friday / Cyber Monday | 15% off sitewide + free shipping | No code needed |
| Flash sales (quarterly) | 10% off select items, 48 hours | Email/SMS exclusive |
| Clearance (end of colorway) | Up to 30% off | "Last Drop" collection |

## 4. Bundle Architecture

Bundles are the primary AOV lever. Every bundle should feel like a complete thought — not a random grouping, but a curated set that tells a story.

### Bundle 1: The Family Fern Set (Tees)

- **Contents:** Mama Fern Tee + Papa Fern Tee + Little Fern Kids Tee or Baby Fern Onesie
- **Individual total:** $34 + $34 + $24 = **$92** (with kids tee) or $34 + $34 + $22 = **$90** (with onesie)
- **Bundle price:** **$79**
- **Savings:** $11–$13 (12–14% off)
- **Shopify setup:** Create as a single product with variant options for each family member's size + child garment type

### Bundle 2: The Cozy Family Set (Crewnecks)

- **Contents:** Mama Fern Crewneck + Papa Fern Crewneck + Little Fern Kids Crewneck
- **Individual total:** $52 + $52 + $38 = **$142**
- **Bundle price:** **$125**
- **Savings:** $17 (12% off)
- **Positioning:** Fall/winter family photo set, holiday gift

### Bundle 3: The New Mama Welcome Box

- **Contents:** Mama Fern Everyday Tee + Baby Fern Onesie + Fern Market Tote
- **Individual total:** $34 + $22 + $18 = **$74**

### Bundle 5: The Accessories Add-On Pack

- **Contents:** Fern Market Tote + Fern Beanie
- **Individual total:** $18 + $22 = **$40**
- **Bundle price:** **$35**
- **Savings:** $5 (12% off)
- **Positioning:** Cart add-on for customers near the free shipping threshold. Also works as a standalone gift.

### Bundle Strategy Rules

1. **Always discount bundles 10–15%** vs. individual pricing — enough to feel valuable, not so much that it trains discount dependency
2. **Name bundles like experiences**, not product lists — "The New Mama Welcome Box" not "Tee + Onesie + Tote Bundle"
3. **Every bundle should cross at least one family member line** (mom + kid, mom + dad, etc.) to maximize the "family brand" identity
4. **Feature bundles on the homepage** and in the cart drawer cross-sell section
5. **Use Shopify's Bundler app** (free plan) or create as a single product with variant selectors for each included item's size

## 5. Creative Direction Per Product

### Overall Design Language

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Small, not loud** | Embroidery and graphics are pocket-sized, left chest or center chest. No oversized prints. |
| **Tonal and textural** | Prefer tone-on-tone embroidery (cream on cream, sage on sage). Let the fabric be the star. |
| **Nature-inspired motifs** | Fern fronds, fiddleheads, simple leaf outlines, seed pods, small botanical line drawings. |
| **Hand-feel typography** | Soft hand-lettered script for "mama fern" / "papa fern" / "little fern" — not a generic sans-serif. |
| **Coordinate, don't match identically** | Mom/Dad/Kids versions should feel related but not identical — same colorway, slightly different design execution. |

### Design System: The Fern Motifs

These are the visual elements that appear across all products:

| Motif | Name | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| 🌿 | **The Frond** | Full unfurled fern leaf — used on totes, as a standalone accent beside text |
| 🌀 | **The Fiddlehead** | Curled baby fern — used on baby/kids items, symbolizes new growth |
| 🌱 | **The Sprout** | Simple two-leaf seedling — used as a small accent mark, like a period at the end of text |
| ✿ | **The Bloom** | Abstract flower/fern hybrid — reserved for seasonal designs (Mother's Day, Spring) |

### Product-Specific Creative Direction

#### Mama Fern Everyday Tee
- **Primary design:** "mama fern" in custom hand-lettered script, embroidered on left chest
- **Accent:** Small frond motif beside the text, ~0.5" tall
- **Thread color:** Tonal (cream thread on oat fabric, sage thread on sage fabric, terracotta thread on terracotta)
- **Alternate design (V2):** "rooted" in small block capitals below the fern frond — no "mama fern" text
- **Design placement:** Left chest, 2.5" from collar seam, centered on chest panel

#### Papa Fern Everyday Tee
- **Primary design:** "papa fern" in the same hand-lettered script family, embroidered on left chest
- **Accent:** Small frond motif beside text — slightly larger and more angular than mama version (same frond, different angle)
- **Thread color:** Tonal, matching fabric
- **Design note:** Subtler execution than the mama tee — dads tend to prefer less decorative, more understated

#### Little Fern Kids Tee
- **Primary design:** "little fern" in a rounder, more playful version of the script — same font family, slightly bouncier
- **Accent:** The Fiddlehead (curled fern) replacing the full frond — symbolizing that they're still growing
- **Placement:** Center chest, slightly higher than adult placement to account for kids proportions
- **Alternate design:** A scattered pattern of 3–4 tiny fern leaves across the chest, no text

#### Baby Fern Onesie
- **Primary design:** "baby fern" in the softest version of the hand-lettered script
- **Accent:** The Fiddlehead, slightly larger than on the kids tee — the hero graphic for this product
- **Placement:** Center chest
- **Decoration method:** Screen print (softer hand-feel than embroidery for baby items against sensitive skin)
- **Color:** Matching ink on fabric (tonal) or a single-shade darker for subtle contrast

#### Mama Fern Cozy Crewneck
- **Primary design:** "mama fern" in arched text across center chest — larger than the tee placement
- **Style:** Embroidered in tonal thread (tone-on-tone)
- **Design note:** The arch gives it a vintage athletic feel. Premium without being fussy.
- **Alternate design:** A large, single fern frond embroidered on the upper back between the shoulder blades (no text on front)

#### Papa Fern Classic Crewneck
- **Primary design:** "papa fern" in small block letters, left chest — matching the tee placement, but slightly larger for the heavier garment
- **Style:** Embroidered in tonal thread
- **Design note:** Understated. Dads who wear this should feel like they're wearing a nice plain crewneck that happens to have a small detail.

#### Little Fern Kids Crewneck
- **Primary design:** "little fern" in arched playful text — mirroring the Mama Fern Crewneck arch but with the kids-specific bouncy typography
- **Accent:** Fiddlehead beneath the arch text
- **Placement:** Center chest

#### The Fern Market Tote
- **Primary design:** "mama fern" script + The Frond (full fern leaf), centered on one face of the tote
- **Size:** Design area approximately 8" x 6"
- **Decoration method:** Screen print (single color, tonal ink on canvas)
- **Alternate design:** Just The Frond, large format, no text — botanical illustration style

#### The Fern Beanie
- **Primary design:** Small embroidered Frond on the cuff fold — no text
- **Size:** Approximately 1" tall
- **Thread color:** Contrasting (sage thread on cream beanie, cream thread on sage beanie)
- **Design note:** The beanie is the exception to the tonal rule — a small pop of contrast makes the embroidery visible in photos and at a distance

#### The Family Fern Set
- **Packaging design:** Custom tissue paper in cream with a fern frond pattern
- **Set presentation:** All three pieces folded and layered in a branded box (for gift-readiness)
- **Insert card:** "Welcome to the fern family" with care instructions and a QR code linking to the Instagram

## 7. Photography & Content Shot List

### Shot Types Needed Per Product

Each product needs **5–7 images** in Shopify. Here's the standard shot list:

| Shot # | Type | Description | Background |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Flat lay — hero** | Product laid flat, centered, full garment visible | Cream linen or light wood surface |
| 2 | **Flat lay — detail** | Close-up of embroidery/print detail + fabric texture | Same surface, tighter crop |
| 3 | **Lifestyle — solo** | Product worn by a real person, natural light, candid feel | Home environment (kitchen, porch, living room) |
| 4 | **Lifestyle — family** | Product worn in context with coordinating family pieces | Same home environment, multiple family members |
| 5 | **Detail — fabric** | Extreme close-up showing cotton weave, softness, tags | Neutral, macro lens |
| 6 | **Scale — folded** | Product neatly folded showing the label/tag | Styled shelf or drawer |
| 7 | **Back view** | Back of the garment (for crewnecks with potential back design) | Same as hero flat lay |

### Lifestyle Photography Direction

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Setting** | Real homes. Wood floors, vintage furniture, cast iron on the stove, bread on the counter, plants on windowsills. The "crunchy cozy" aesthetic. |
| **Lighting** | Natural window light. Golden hour. No studio strobes for lifestyle. |
| **Models** | Real families. Diverse. Not agency-polished — authentic and warm. Kids should be mid-motion (playing, reaching, laughing), not posing. |
| **Styling** | Minimal. The product is the focus. Style with natural textures — raw wood, ceramic, linen, wicker. |
| **Color grading** | Warm. Slightly desaturated greens. Soft shadows. Think film photography, not HDR. |
| **What to avoid** | Pure white backgrounds. Studio lighting. Over-posed models. Generic "influencer" styling. Anything that reads as "stock photo." |

### The "Fern Aesthetic" Mood Board Keywords

Use these when directing photographers or searching for reference images:
- Warm minimalism
- Organic cotton texture
- Sourdough family lifestyle
- Crunchy cozy home
- Botanical simplicity
- Earthy natural tones
- Cast iron and linen
- Farm table family breakfast
- Morning light through curtains
- Kids in the garden

## 8. Social Media Content Strategy

### Platform-Specific Approach

#### TikTok (Primary Discovery Engine)

**Post frequency:** 5–7x per week
**Format:** Short-form video, 15–60 seconds
**Tone:** Lo-fi, authentic, founder-led. iPhone-quality outperforms studio quality.

**Content Pillars for Product Posts:**

| Pillar | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Fabric reveal** | Close-up video showing organic cotton texture, softness | "The difference you can feel. 100% organic cotton." Slow-motion fabric crinkle, hand running over texture. |
| **Family coordination** | Get-ready-with-me showing the whole family dressing in Mama Fern | "POV: you finally matched the whole family and nobody cried" — fast cuts of each person getting dressed |
| **Unboxing** | First-person unboxing of a Mama Fern order | Tissue paper crinkle ASMR, reveal each piece, show the insert card |
| **Behind the scenes** | Packing orders, designing new pieces, reviewing samples | "Pack orders with me at Mama Fern HQ (my kitchen table)" |
| **Crunchy mom content** | Trend-riding with the product as a natural background element | "Things in my cart as a crunchy mom" — product worn casually, not featured as the main focus |
| **Problem/solution** | Addressing a real pain point | "Tired of baby clothes that feel scratchy? This is 100% organic cotton" — show onesie vs. fast fashion onesie |

**TikTok Caption Strategy:**
- Lead with a hook in the first 2 seconds (text overlay on screen)
- Use keywords for TikTok search: "organic cotton", "crunchy mom", "family matching", "baby clothes"
- Keep captions short: one line + 3–5 hashtags
- Hashtags: `#crunchymom` `#organicbaby` `#familymatching` `#mamafern` `#slowfashion`

#### Instagram (Brand Home Base)

**Post frequency:** 4–5 feed posts + 2–3 Reels + daily Stories
**Feed aesthetic:** Warm, cream-and-green dominant grid. Alternate product shots and lifestyle images.

**Content Mix:**
- 40% Product / styling (flat lays, on-body, detail shots)
- 30% Lifestyle / mood (home scenes, family moments, texture close-ups)
- 20% Community / UGC (customer reposts, tagged photos)
- 10% Founder / behind the scenes

**Instagram-Specific Formats:**

| Format | Content | Frequency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Carousel** | "3 ways to style the Mama Fern Tee" — 3–5 slides showing different outfit pairings | 2x/week |
| **Reel** | Repurposed TikTok content (remove watermark) | 3x/week |
| **Single image** | Hero product photo or lifestyle shot | 2x/week |
| **Stories** | Daily: polls ("sage or terracotta?"), Q&A, new arrival teasers, UGC reposts | Daily |
| **Highlights** | Permanent: Our Story, New Arrivals, Real Customers, Behind the Scenes, Size Guide | Maintained |

#### Pinterest (Long-Tail Discovery)

**Pin frequency:** 5–10 pins per week
**Strategy:** Create shoppable pins linked directly to product pages. Pinterest content drives traffic for 6 months to 3 years.

**Board Structure:**

| Board Name | Content | Target Keywords |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Mama Fern Collection | All product images | organic cotton tees, mom apparel |
| Family Outfit Ideas | Family coordination lifestyle shots | matching family outfits, family photo outfits |
| Crunchy Mom Style | Lifestyle aesthetic pins + product | crunchy mom fashion, earthy style |
| Organic Kids Clothing | Kids and baby product images | organic cotton kids, organic baby clothes |
| Gift Ideas for Moms | Gift-ready bundles and products | mom gift ideas, baby shower gifts |
| Capsule Wardrobe | Styling combinations from the line | family capsule wardrobe, slow fashion |

Use these prompts with AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Flux) for mockup imagery, mood boards, and social media content before professional photography is available.

### Product Mockup Prompts

**Mama Fern Everyday Tee — Flat Lay:**
```
Flat lay photograph of a relaxed-fit women's t-shirt in soft sage green,
organic cotton, with small embroidered text "mama fern" in tonal thread on

a small sprig of dried eucalyptus beside it. Warm natural light from the
left. Overhead camera angle. Minimal, editorial styling. Soft shadows.
```

**Family Matching Set — Lifestyle:**

Warm lifestyle photograph of a young family (mom, dad, toddler) wearing
coordinating organic cotton t-shirts in oat cream color, standing in a
bright kitchen with wood countertops, cast iron pan, and a sourdough loaf

dad holding toddler, mom laughing. Film photography feel, slightly
desaturated greens, warm tones. Natural, not posed.
```

**Baby Fern Onesie — Detail:**
```
Close-up product photograph of a baby bodysuit in soft blush pink organic
cotton, with a small curled fern frond (fiddlehead) printed in a slightly
darker pink on the chest. Nickel-free snap closure visible. The onesie is

```

**Fern Market Tote — Lifestyle:**

tote bag in natural undyed color with "mama fern" script and a fern frond
printed on the side. She is at an outdoor farmers market with fresh

daylight, slightly overcast for even lighting. Shot from waist-down,
showing the tote and her hand. Earthy, botanical mood.
```

shelving with ceramic dishes, a cast iron skillet on the stove, a
sourdough loaf cooling on a wire rack, a small potted fern on the
windowsill. Morning light streaming through a curtain. Earthy tones —
cream, sage, terracotta, warm wood. Film photography grain. No people.
```

**The Fern Aesthetic — Family Moment:**
```
Warm photograph of a young family sitting on a front porch with vintage
wooden railings. Parents on a bench, toddler playing with a toy on the
porch floor. All wearing organic cotton basics in coordinating earth
tones. Late afternoon golden light. Shallow depth of field. Candid,
unposed, real moment. Warm color grade with soft greens.
```

**Texture Detail — Organic Cotton:**
```
Extreme macro photograph of organic cotton fabric in a sage green color,
showing the weave structure and natural fiber texture. Soft directional
light creating gentle shadows in the weave. Shallow depth of field.

grid-ready composition with space for text overlay.

### Phase 2: First 30 Days — Optimization

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| Week 1 | Monitor which products sell first. Identify the hero product. Push it harder. |
| Week 2 | Review cart abandonment data. Adjust product descriptions for top-abandoned items. |
| Week 3 | Collect and display first reviews. Follow up personally with every customer. |
| Week 4 | Analyze AOV. If below $75, push bundle visibility. If above $75, consider raising free shipping threshold to $85. |

### Phase 3: Month 2–3 — Expand the Line

Based on first-month data, plan the first expansion:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Tees outsell crewnecks 3:1+ | Add new tee designs/sayings before new crewneck styles |
| Baby onesie is top gift item | Add a second onesie design (seasonal or alternate graphic) |
| Tote sells primarily as a cart add-on | Consider a second accessory (hat, headband, scrunchie) |
| Family Set is the top AOV product | Create a crewneck version of the family set sooner |
| Specific colorway dominates | Expand that colorway to more products; deprioritize underperformers |

### Phase 4: Seasonal Drop Integration

The evergreen line stays permanent. Seasonal drops layer on top:

| Season | Potential Drop | Evergreen Tie-In |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Spring (March) | Spring Garden Collection — floral fern prints, pastel colorways | Coordinate with evergreen Oat Cream and Sage |
| Mother's Day (May) | "Made for Every Kind of Mama" limited tee with special design | Bundle with evergreen Mama Fern Tee + exclusive item |
| Summer (June) | Lightweight tanks + kids shorts in summer colorways | Same fabric family as evergreen tees |
| Fall (Sept) | Harvest palette — warm brown, burnt orange, deep sage | Crewneck-focused drop, coordinates with evergreen crewnecks |
| Holiday (Nov) | Holiday graphic onesies + gift sets | Gift-wrapped version of evergreen bundles + limited designs |
