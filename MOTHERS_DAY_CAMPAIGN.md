# Mama Fern — Mother's Day 2026 Campaign

> **Date:** Sunday, May 10, 2026
> **Campaign window:** March 16 – May 10, 2026 (8 weeks)
> **Goal:** Use Mother's Day as the brand launch moment. "Mama" is in the name — own it.

---

## The Strategy

Mother's Day is not a side campaign for Mama Fern. It is the launch vehicle. The brand name makes this the most natural entry point to market. Every first impression of Mama Fern should feel like it was made for this moment.

**Core idea:** *"Made for every kind of mama."*

This campaign:
1. Builds an email list in weeks 1-4
2. Seeds product to influencers in weeks 2-5
3. Opens the store to early access in week 6
4. Runs the full Mother's Day push in weeks 7-8
5. Captures gift buyers, self-purchasing moms, and family coordinators simultaneously

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Build Anticipation (March 16 – April 5 / Weeks 1-3)

**Store is NOT open yet.** This phase builds an audience before launch.

#### Week 1 (March 16-22) — Start Content + Waitlist

- [ ] Launch a simple waitlist landing page at mamafern.com
  - Headline: "Grounded family apparel. Launching for Mother's Day."
  - Email capture: "Get early access + a launch-day discount"
  - One hero image showing the product aesthetic (even mockups work)
- [ ] Start posting TikTok content (3-5x/week):
  - "Why I'm starting a family apparel brand" (founder story)
  - Fabric close-ups with text overlay: "organic cotton everything"
  - "Crunchy mom starter pack" trend content featuring your product vision
  - Behind-the-scenes: picking fabrics, first samples arriving
- [ ] Start Instagram account:
  - 3-4 feed posts establishing the brand aesthetic (cream/fern/terracotta palette)

  - Focus on: authentic engagement, not follower count
  - Prioritize creators who show real family life, not polished production
- [ ] Send DMs offering free product in exchange for honest content — no payment required

**Target:** 250 email subscribers, 10 product samples shipped

#### Week 3 (March 30 – April 5) — Build Social Proof

  - "What's in the box" prep content (packaging, tags, insert cards)
- [ ] Collect any early influencer content and save it for launch week
- [ ] Set up Judge.me in Shopify admin (review requests will auto-send once orders happen)

## Influencer Strategy for Mother's Day

### Sourcing

Find 15-20 creators across these hashtags:
- `#crunchymom` / `#crunchymomlife`
- `#organicbaby` / `#organickids`
- `#matchingfamily` / `#familymatching`
- `#momlife` / `#boymom` / `#girlmom`
- `#organicclothing` / `#slowfashion`
- `#mothersday2026` / `#mothersdaygifts`

### Selection Criteria

- 1K-50K followers (nano/micro)
- Engagement rate above 3% (check last 10 posts)
- Content style matches Mama Fern aesthetic (warm, real, not overly polished)
- Has kids visible in content (family brand fit)
- Active on TikTok, Instagram, or both

### Outreach Timeline

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| Week 2 | DM 20 creators, offer free family set |
| Week 3 | Ship to first 10 who respond |
| Week 4 | Ship to remaining respondents |
| Week 5 | Confirm posting schedule for weeks 6-7 |
| Week 6 | First wave: 2-3 posts/day around launch |
| Week 7 | Second wave: "Mother's Day gift idea" themed posts |

### Content Briefs (Suggested, Not Required)

Give influencers freedom but suggest angles:
- "Unboxing our first Mama Fern family set"
- "Mother's Day gift idea: matching organic cotton for the whole family"
- "Why I love that this brand uses organic cotton for my kids"
- "Rating this new family apparel brand — honest review"

### Budget

Product seeding only for the first wave — no cash payment. Total cost = cost of goods for 15-20 family sets. If a set costs $25-$40 to produce, total influencer budget = **$375-$800 in product**.

---

## Paid Advertising (Minimal, Targeted)

**Do not run cold traffic ads before May 1.** Build organic momentum first.

### Week 7 Only: Retargeting + Content Boost

| Tactic | Budget | Audience |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Boost top TikTok (highest organic views) | $50-$100 | Broad (let TikTok algo optimize) |
| Instagram Reels boost | $50-$100 | Women 25-40, interests: organic, motherhood, family |
| Meta retargeting | $100-$200 | Site visitors last 14 days who didn't purchase |
| Google Shopping (if set up) | $50-$100 | "organic cotton mom gift", "mother's day family outfit" |

**Total paid budget for Mother's Day campaign: $250-$500**

This is optional. If organic content and influencers are driving traffic, skip paid entirely and reinvest in product seeding for the next drop.

## What Must Be Built Before March 16

This campaign depends on having a working store. Minimum viable storefront for launch:

- [ ] **Checkout flow** — `cart.checkoutUrl` redirect working
- [ ] **Product pages** — all Mother's Day products live with images, variants, descriptions
- [ ] **Collections** — Moms, Kids, Family, Mother's Day 2026
- [ ] **Cart** — add, update, remove items + subtotal display
- [ ] **Email capture** — popup or inline form on homepage
- [ ] **Logo + branding** — "Mama Fern" (not "Minimal Store"), correct palette
- [ ] **Mobile responsive** — most traffic will be mobile (TikTok/Instagram referrals)

### Nice to Have (But Not Blockers)

- [ ] "Complete the Family Look" cross-sell section
- [ ] Gift wrapping option in cart
- [ ] Blog / about page
- [ ] Account / order history pages
- [ ] Search

## Post-Mother's Day: What Happens Next

Mother's Day is the launch moment, not the whole business. After May 10:

1. **Send post-purchase emails** — review requests, cross-sell, repeat buyer incentive
2. **Father's Day (June 21)** — pivot Dad collection spotlight, reuse the campaign framework
3. **Summer drop** — use Mother's Day customer data to inform which products/colorways resonated
4. **Analyze cohort** — which acquisition channel produced the highest LTV buyers? Double down on that for Q3
5. **Keep the email list warm** — weekly content emails through June, not just promotional blasts

The Mother's Day buyers are your founding customer cohort. Treat them accordingly — they will define your repeat purchase rate and word-of-mouth trajectory for the rest of Year 1.
