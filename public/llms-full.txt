## Brand Story
Mama Fern started with a simple idea: family apparel that feels as good as it looks. 
As parents who care deeply about what touches our family's skin, we wanted clothing that 
combined beautiful, earthy designs with genuinely skin-friendly fabrics. Every piece in 
our collection is made from natural materials — organic cotton, linen, and bamboo — chosen 
for breathability, softness, and durability. We believe that family moments deserve to be 
comfortable, and that what your family wears can reflect the same values you bring to 
everything else: natural living, outdoor adventure, and togetherness. Mama Fern is 
grounded family apparel for the modern crunchy family — designed in the United States 
and crafted with care for real families living real life.
